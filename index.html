        <h3> About Jermany </h3>
        <p class="left"> After graduating from North Carolina Agricultural & Technical State University, I became a Lab Animal Technician and work with 3 strains of mice. Although I adore having an easy workload, my mind is not stimulated and I am not given an opportunity to create.</p>
        <p> Deciding to start the Software Engineering bootcamp wasn't the hard part, deciding to challenge myself was. 
            I am excited to learn with Thinkful and to learn all there is to know about Software Engineering.</p>
